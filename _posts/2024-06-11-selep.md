title: "SeLeP: Learning Based Semantic Prefetching for Exploratory Database Workloads"
# subtitle: Learned indexes leverage Machine Learning (ML) models to approximate the distribution of data towards building auxiliary data structures that can replace traditional database indexes. Learned indexes deliver the promise of reduced memory footprint and faster data retrieval. We investigate the efficiency of existing learned models, and propose advancements with respect to the model complexity as well as suitability of the learned indexes for the on-disk placement.

<p><b>
Semantic prefetching aims to incorporate actual data values, rather than just logical block addresses, in access pattern recognition. This method has proven to be more effective than address-based prefetchers, as the result of each query in an exploratory session influences the formulation of subsequent queries. This project focuses on developing an accurate and scalable semantic prefetcher to enhance the interactivity of exploratory tools by fetching data in advance of requests. We formulate the prefetching task as a time-series forecasting problem, learning the underlying access patterns using the encodings of data values from previously accessed blocks. Our approach is designed to improve hit ratios and reduce query I/O time for both navigational and SQL-based workloads.
