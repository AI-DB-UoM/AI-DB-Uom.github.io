    AI-powered databases aim to facilitate data exploration and insight discovery in large and intricate databases commonly found in data-rich industries and scientific fields. These insights can improve business processes, reduce production costs, and lead to new discoveries in scientific disciplines. Despite their benefits, data exploration often proves arduous and time-consuming, demanding substantial expertise to prepare databases for analysis.
    This project pioneers a new generation of AI-powered self-driving databases, leveraging Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to automate the complex and labor-intensive tasks associated with database preparation, typically carried out by expensive specialists.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Automatically Fine-Tuning Databases:</strong> Through judicious selection of physical database design structures (backed up by safety guarantees) to ensure fast responses to user queries.</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitating Data Retrieval:</strong> Through space-efficient (machine-) learned indexes tailored for on-disk placement.</li>
    <li><strong>Reducing Data Access Overheads:</strong> Through semantics-driven pre-fetching guided by anticipated user interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Overall, AI-powered databases may offer significant benefits to scientific research and organizations lacking data expertise by streamlining analysis processes and removing the need for specialized database knowledge.
